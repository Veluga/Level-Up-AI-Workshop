# The Lookahead
* You are a third year student at university
* A friend suggested you have a look at https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/ which is based on a highly cited study by Oxford University academics (https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf)
* Unfortunately, your dream job is one which is at risk of computerisation
* As you are mostly done with your degree, you want to finish it
* However, to better prepare for the future, you want to use this and next years summer break to diversify your into other areas of employment
* Questions to work on:
  * What alternative career path could be at least somewhat interesting to you?
  * Develop a strategy for execution during the summer breaks to increase your chances of being employed in a job outside of your own discipline
  * What issues will you face (weakest skills)?
  * What skills can you bring to the table that could prove advantageous to the new discipline you chose (strongest skills)?
